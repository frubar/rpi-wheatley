Intelligence Dampening Sphere, Model Raspberry Pi.

## Introduction

A quick'n'dirty Django app to show the power of a Raspberry Pi and the camera
module. Simple set up the cam, shoot a photo and twitter it.

### Motivation

The LinuxDay AT on Saturday, 23th November 2013 in Dornbirn. Just to have more
than nothing at our booth :P

## Installation

You need Django 1.6 and some extra python modules.

* django-bootstrap-form >= 3.0
* pytz >= 2013.8
* twython >= 3.1.0

Clone the project, have a look at the Django documentation and be happy :)
